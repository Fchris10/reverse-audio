Little project that shows in depth how to reverse an audio file using Python‚Äôs built-in `wave` library.

---

## Features
1. Select an audio file via a simple **file picker** (`easygui`)  
2. Supports **.wav** and **.mp3** (mp3 files are converted to wav with `pydub`)  
3. Generates a completely **reversed audio file**  
4. Prints detailed audio information:
  -  Sample width  
  -  Number of frames  
  -  Sample rate (frame rate)  
  -  Number of channels  
  -  Duration

## üì¶ Requirements
Make sure you have **Python ‚â• 3.7** and install the dependencies:  

```bash
pip install pydub easygui
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: To handle .mp3 files with pydub, you need ffmpeg
```
